# python-challenge

This challenge it's my first code. Looks like a Victor Frankenstein creation but it's nice.

I used stack overflow, chat gpt, the solutions on classes, and some you tube videos.
I have learned a lot, but dictioaries is soimething I need to study more, append funtion too. 
There are a lot of things that I´m missing, but there are some I´m using.

I hope you can undertand the code. 

Thank you.
